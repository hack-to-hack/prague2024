# Hack-to-Hack Co-work: To Prague from Berlin

**May 27-30, 2024 - Prague, Czech Republic üá®üáø**

üí¨ Matrix chat: https://matrix.to/#/#hack-to-hack:gwei.cz

## Intro

We propose the concept of a co-work space in Prague, Czech Republic from 27-30 May, for hackers to bridge the gap between two hackathons on adjacent weekends: [ETHBerlin](https://ethberlin.org/) (24-26 May) and [ETHPrague](https://ethprague.com/) (31 May to 2 June). We aim to empower international collaboration at the crossroads of east and west, and kick-off the summer of buidling in 2024.
Milestones in terms of putting on the event are:

- Securing general support from community
- Selecting a venue in Prague
- Securing overall funding (estimated at between $20k and $50k - dependent on venue and capacity)
- Announce the concept, and start accepting applications to attend
- Organise The Hacktrain: a nomadic adventure to mark the migration from Goerli to Holesky

Hack-to-Hack is an initiative to empower interoperability between hackers, and between hackathons. It aims to use open source and decentralised systems for management of all data submitted by participants, and to uphold an individual's self-sovereignty throughout the participation in the event.

Such an initiative has inevitable real-world costs. We aim to keep these as lean as possible, while providing a comfortable environment for collaborating, hacking, and enjoying. Costs largely relate to rental of a location, and tables / chairs / power / internet, to provide basic needs for a hacking co-work. We propose to provide minimal catering, and instead to inform participants about local options for food and drink, as a way to encourage hackers to get to know the city of Prague.

## Focus 

There have been considerable advancements in software primitives in our space. We are, however, losing sight of some original cypherpunk ideals of self-sovereignty, and running your own hardware infra.

As such, we welcome all hardware and software hackers to attend an open hackspace for experimentation and a series of practical workshops on various topics, relating to the intersection of hardware and software. 

### Topics

 - running your own node
   - RPC endpoints
   - restaking
   - distributed validator technology
 - communications and media
   - personal devices and HCI
   - backend infra  
   - p2p networking infra 
 - proving and acceleration
   - FPGAs, GPUs 
   - client side proving
   - participating in proving markets
 - operations
   - booting and deployment
   - configuration management
   - software development lifecycle
 - open standards
   - software
   - hardware

### Structure 
 - Open Hack Space
 - Workshops
 - Show and Tell
 - Closing Ceremony 

### BYOH: Bring your own hardware.

Think rasbperrypi, pinephone, rock5b, GPU, FPGA, pinewatch, 3d printers, TVs, ATMs, cameras, microphones, screens, speakers, etc. 

## Venue

In terms of venue, the event will be similar to Devconnect Coworking in Istanbul. The basic aim is to provide a comfortable environment for collaborating, hacking, and enjoying - while keeping a sustainable budget without excessive spending.

### Proposed venues

| Name | Location | Capacity (evening) | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Kas√°rna Karl√≠n](https://kasarnakarlin.cz/en/main-page) | Karl√≠n, Praha 8 | 300 (500+) | big courtyard, enclosed area |
| [Pragovka](https://pragovka.com/en) | Vysoƒçany, Praha 9 | Flexible (500+) | flexibility, not in center |
| [Loft BubNY](https://loftbubny.cz/) | Hole≈°ovice, Praha 7 | 100 (200) | compact, no services around |
